{"name":"Coreutils","tagline":"Mirror of git://git.savannah.gnu.org/coreutils.git","body":"These are the GNU core utilities.  This package is the union of\r\nthe GNU fileutils, sh-utils, and textutils packages.\r\n\r\nMost of these programs have significant advantages over their Unix\r\ncounterparts, such as greater speed, additional options, and fewer\r\narbitrary limits.\r\n\r\nThe programs that can be built with this package are:\r\n\r\n  [ arch base64 basename cat chcon chgrp chmod chown chroot cksum comm cp\r\n  csplit cut date dd df dir dircolors dirname du echo env expand expr\r\n  factor false fmt fold groups head hostid hostname id install join kill\r\n  link ln logname ls md5sum mkdir mkfifo mknod mktemp mv nice nl nohup\r\n  nproc numfmt od paste pathchk pinky pr printenv printf ptx pwd readlink\r\n  realpath rm rmdir runcon seq sha1sum sha224sum sha256sum sha384sum sha512sum\r\n  shred shuf sleep sort split stat stdbuf stty sum sync tac tail tee test\r\n  timeout touch tr true truncate tsort tty uname unexpand uniq unlink\r\n  uptime users vdir wc who whoami yes\r\n\r\nSee the file NEWS for a list of major changes in the current release.\r\n\r\nIf you obtained this file as part of a \"git clone\", then see the\r\nREADME-hacking file.  If this file came to you as part of a tar archive,\r\nthen see the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.\r\n\r\nThese programs are intended to conform to POSIX (with BSD and other\r\nextensions), like the rest of the GNU system.  By default they conform\r\nto older POSIX (1003.2-1992), and therefore support obsolete usages\r\nlike \"head -10\" and \"chown owner.group file\".  This default is\r\noverridden at build-time by the value of <unistd.h>'s _POSIX2_VERSION\r\nmacro, and this in turn can be overridden at runtime as described in\r\nthe documentation under \"Standards conformance\".\r\n\r\nThe ls, dir, and vdir commands are all separate executables instead of\r\none program that checks argv[0] because people often rename these\r\nprograms to things like gls, gnuls, l, etc.  Renaming a program\r\nfile shouldn't affect how it operates, so that people can get the\r\nbehavior they want with whatever name they want.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Paul Eggert, Brian Matthews, Bruce Evans, Karl Berry,\r\nKaveh Ghazi, and François Pinard for help with debugging and porting\r\nthese programs.  Many thanks to all of the people who have taken the\r\ntime to submit problem reports and fixes.  All contributed changes are\r\nattributed in the commit logs.\r\n\r\nAnd thanks to the following people who have provided accounts for\r\nportability testing on many different types of systems: Bob Proulx,\r\nChristian Robert, François Pinard, Greg McGary, Harlan Stenn,\r\nJoel N. Weber, Mark D. Roth, Matt Schalit, Nelson H. F. Beebe,\r\nRéjean Payette, Sam Tardieu.\r\n\r\nThanks to Michael Stone for inflicting test releases of this package\r\non Debian's unstable distribution, and to all the kind folks who used\r\nthat distribution and found and reported bugs.\r\n\r\nNote that each man page is now automatically generated from a template\r\nand from the corresponding --help usage message.  Patches to the template\r\nfiles (man/*.x) are welcome.  However, the authoritative documentation\r\nis in texinfo form in the doc directory.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****************************************\r\nOn Mac OS X 10.5.1 (Darwin 9.1), test failure\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nMac OS X 10.5.1 (Darwin 9.1) provides only partial (and incompatible)\r\nACL support, so although \"./configure && make\" succeeds, \"make check\"\r\nexposes numerous failures.  The solution is to turn off ACL support\r\nmanually via \"./configure --disable-acl\".  For details, see\r\n<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.coreutils.bugs/12292/focus=12318>.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****************************************\r\nTest failure with NLS and gettext <= 0.17\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nDue to a conflict between libintl.h and gnulib's new xprintf module,\r\nwhen you configure with NLS support, and with a gettext installation\r\nolder than 0.17.1 (not yet released, at the time of this writing),\r\nthen some tests fail, at least on NetBSD 1.6.  To work around it in\r\nthe mean time, you can configure with --disable-nls.  For details,\r\nsee <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.gnulib.bugs/12015/>.\r\n\r\n\r\n***********************\r\nPre-C99 build failure\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nThere is a new, implicit build requirement:\r\nTo build the coreutils from source, you should have a C99-conforming\r\ncompiler, due to the use of declarations after non-declaration statements\r\nin several files in src/.  There is code in configure to find and, if\r\npossible, enable an appropriate compiler.  However, if configure doesn't\r\nfind a C99 compiler, it continues nonetheless, and your build will fail.\r\nIf that happens, simply[*] apply the included patch using the following\r\ncommand, and then run make again:\r\n\r\n  cd src && patch < c99-to-c89.diff\r\n\r\n[*] however, as of coreutils-7.1, the \"c99-to-c89.diff\" file is no longer\r\nmaintained, so even if the patches still apply, the result will be an\r\nincomplete conversion.  It's been 10 years.  Get a decent compiler! ;-)\r\n\r\n\r\n***********************\r\nHPUX 11.x build failure\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nA known problem exists when compiling on HPUX on both hppa and ia64\r\nin 64-bit mode (i.e. +DD64) on HP-UX 11.0, 11.11, and 11.23.  This\r\nis not due to a bug in the package but instead due to a bug in the\r\nsystem header file which breaks things in 64-bit mode.  The default\r\ncompilation mode is 32-bit and the software compiles fine using the\r\ndefault mode.  To build this software in 64-bit mode you will need\r\nto fix the system /usr/include/inttypes.h header file.  After\r\ncorrecting that file the software also compiles fine in 64-bit mode.\r\nHere is one possible patch to correct the problem:\r\n\r\n--- /usr/include/inttypes.h.orig\tThu May 30 01:00:00 1996\r\n+++ /usr/include/inttypes.h\tSun Mar 23 00:20:36 2003\r\n@@ -489 +489 @@\r\n-#ifndef __STDC_32_MODE__\r\n+#ifndef __LP64__\r\n\r\n\r\n************************\r\nOSF/1 4.0d build failure\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you use /usr/bin/make on an OSF/1 4.0d system, it will fail due\r\nto the presence of the \"[\" target.  That version of make appears to\r\ntreat \"[\" as some syntax relating to locks.  To work around that,\r\nthe best solution is to use GNU make.  Otherwise, simply remove\r\nall mention of \"[$(EXEEXT)\" from src/Makefile.\r\n\r\n\r\n*************************************************\r\n\"make check\" failure on IRIX 6.5 and Solaris <= 9\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nUsing the vendor make program to run \"make check\" fails on these two systems.\r\nIf you want to run all of the tests there, use GNU make.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**********************\r\nRunning tests as root:\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nIf you run the tests as root, note that a few of them create files\r\nand/or run programs as a non-root user, 'nobody' by default.\r\nIf you want to use some other non-root username, specify it via\r\nthe NON_ROOT_USERNAME environment variable.  Depending on the\r\npermissions with which the working directories have been created,\r\nusing 'nobody' may fail, because that user won't have the required\r\nread and write access to the build and test directories.\r\nI find that it is best to unpack and build as a non-privileged\r\nuser, and then to run the following command as that user in order\r\nto run the privilege-requiring tests:\r\n\r\n  sudo env PATH=\"$PATH\" NON_ROOT_USERNAME=$USER make -k check-root\r\n\r\nIf you can run the tests as root, please do so and report any\r\nproblems.  We get much less test coverage in that mode, and it's\r\narguably more important that these tools work well when run by\r\nroot than when run by less privileged users.\r\n\r\n\r\n***************\r\nReporting bugs:\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: if you take the time to report a test failure,\r\nplease be sure to include the output of running 'make check'\r\nin verbose mode for each failing test.  For example,\r\nif the test that fails is tests/df/df-P.sh, then you would\r\nrun this command:\r\n\r\n  make check TESTS=tests/df/df-P.sh VERBOSE=yes SUBDIRS=. >> log 2>&1\r\n\r\nFor some tests, you can get even more detail by adding DEBUG=yes.\r\nThen include the contents of the file 'log' in your bug report.\r\n\r\nSend bug reports, questions, comments, etc. to bug-coreutils@gnu.org.\r\nIf you would like to suggest a patch, see the files README-hacking\r\nand HACKING for tips.\r\n\r\n***************************************\r\n\r\nThere are many tests, but nowhere near as many as we need.\r\nAdditions and corrections are very welcome.\r\n\r\nIf you see a problem that you've already reported, feel free to re-report\r\nit -- it won't bother me to get a reminder.  Besides, the more messages I\r\nget regarding a particular problem the sooner it'll be fixed -- usually.\r\nIf you sent a complete patch and, after a couple weeks you haven't\r\nreceived any acknowledgement, please ping us.  A complete patch includes\r\na well-written ChangeLog entry, unified (diff -u format) diffs relative\r\nto the most recent test release (or, better, relative to the latest\r\nsources in the public repository), an explanation for why the patch is\r\nnecessary or useful, and if at all possible, enough information to\r\nreproduce whatever problem prompted it.  Plus, you'll earn lots of\r\nkarma if you include a test case to exercise any bug(s) you fix.\r\nHere are instructions for checking out the latest development sources:\r\n\r\n  http://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=coreutils\r\n\r\nIf your patch adds a new feature, please try to get some sort of consensus\r\nthat it is a worthwhile change.  One way to do that is to send mail to\r\ncoreutils@gnu.org including as much description and justification\r\nas you can.  Based on the feedback that generates, you may be able to\r\nconvince us that it's worth adding.  Please also consult the list of\r\npreviously discussed but ultimately rejected feature requests at:\r\nhttp://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/rejected_requests.html\r\n\r\n\r\nWARNING:  Now that we use the ./bootstrap script, you should not run\r\nautoreconf manually.  Doing that will overwrite essential source files\r\nwith older versions, which may make the package unbuildable or introduce\r\nsubtle bugs.\r\n\r\n\r\nWARNING:  If you modify files like configure.in, m4/*.m4, aclocal.m4,\r\nor any Makefile.am, then don't be surprised if what gets regenerated no\r\nlonger works.  To make things work, you'll have to be using appropriate\r\nversions of the tools listed in bootstrap.conf's buildreq string.\r\n\r\nAll of these programs except 'test' recognize the '--version' option.\r\nWhen reporting bugs, please include in the subject line both the package\r\nname/version and the name of the program for which you found a problem.\r\n\r\nFor general documentation on the coding and usage standards\r\nthis distribution follows, see the GNU Coding Standards,\r\nhttp://www.gnu.org/prep/standards_toc.html.\r\n\r\nFor any copyright year range specified as YYYY-ZZZZ in this package\r\nnote that the range specifies every single year in that closed interval.\r\n\r\nMail suggestions and bug reports for these programs to\r\nthe address on the last line of --help output.\r\n\r\n\r\n========================================================================\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 1998-2013 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\r\n\r\nPermission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document\r\nunder the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or\r\nany later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no\r\nInvariant Sections, with no Front-Cover Texts, and with no Back-Cover\r\nTexts.
